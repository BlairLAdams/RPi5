# Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence

The [Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW)](../glossary.md#data-warehouse-edw) is a central platform that consolidates cleaned, structured data from multiple systems to support analytics and reporting.  
In a water utility, this may include combining [SCADA](../glossary.md#scada), [CMMS](../glossary.md#cmms), [GIS](../glossary.md#gis), and [LIMS](../glossary.md#line-of-business-system) data  
into a single environment that supports decision-making, regulatory compliance, and long-term planning.

[Business Intelligence (BI)](../glossary.md#business-intelligence-bi) tools enable users to explore, visualize, and report on this warehouse data through dashboards and charts.  
This layer builds on [reference data](../glossary.md#reference-data), [data modeling](../glossary.md#data-modeling), [data quality](../glossary.md#data-quality), and [stewardship](../glossary.md#stewardship) practices.
