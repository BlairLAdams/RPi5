# Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence
Data warehousing consolidates data from multiple systems into a centralized, consistent environment to support reporting, analysis, and decision-making. For water utilities, this means integrating SCADA, CMMS, GIS, LIMS, and ERP data into a structured repository where operations, engineering, and management can access a shared view of system performance, compliance, and planning metrics.
Business intelligence (BI) builds on the warehouse by delivering dashboards, visualizations, and reports that translate raw data into actionable insights. Together, warehousing and BI enable utilities to move from fragmented data silos to integrated decision support.

## Objective
Deploy a centralized data environment that supports consistent reporting and empowers users through shared, visual access to key utility metrics.

### Key Results
- Create at least one working data mart from integrated source data (e.g., Silver layer)  
- Build and publish a dashboard showing three operational or compliance metrics  
- Document the refresh frequency and data lineage for one report  
- Onboard at least two new users to the BI tool with training and feedback  

## Core Processes
- Data ingestion, transformation, and loading (ELT/ETL)  
- Semantic layer and data model creation  
- Dashboard and report design standards  
- User access provisioning and training  
- Report lifecycle management (development, approval, retirement)  

## Suggested Metrics
- Number of active users accessing BI tools each month  
- Percent of reports backed by certified warehouse tables  
- Average dashboard load time and data freshness lag  
- Number of metrics standardized across departments
