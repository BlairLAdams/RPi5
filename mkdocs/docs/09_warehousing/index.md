# Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence

The [Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW)](../glossary.md#data-warehouse-edw) is a central platform that consolidates cleaned, structured data from multiple systems to support analytics and reporting.  
In a water utility, this may include combining [SCADA](../glossary.md#scada), [CMMS](../glossary.md#cmms), [GIS](../glossary.md#gis), and [LIMS](../glossary.md#line-of-business-system) data  
into a single environment that supports decision-making, regulatory compliance, and long-term planning.

[Business Intelligence (BI)](../glossary.md#business-intelligence-bi) tools enable users to explore, visualize, and report on this warehouse data through dashboards and charts.  
This layer builds on [reference data](../glossary.md#reference-data), [data modeling](../glossary.md#data-modeling), [data quality](../glossary.md#data-quality), and [stewardship](../glossary.md#stewardship) practices.

## Objective

Build and maintain a centralized, trusted EDW that supports consistent, reusable metrics and enables users to access reliable insights.

---

### Key Results

- Create one [data mart](../glossary.md#data-mart) with clean, joined tables for a priority domain  
- Develop three dashboards or reports using EDW data  
- Align at least two reports to approved [reference data](../glossary.md#reference-data) or [data dictionary](../glossary.md#data-dictionary) definitions  
- Define ownership and refresh logic for core metrics  

---

## Core Processes

- [ETL](../glossary.md#etl-extract-transform-load) or [ELT](../glossary.md#elt-extract-load-transform) job design and orchestration  
- Metric definition and validation  
- Semantic layer and [data modeling](../glossary.md#data-modeling) alignment  
- Report lifecycle management (create, certify, retire)  
- User onboarding and [data literacy](../glossary.md#data-literacy) support  

---

## Suggested Metrics

- Count of certified reports using EDW data  
- Number of users actively accessing dashboards  
- Frequency of dashboard refresh failures  
- Percentage of metrics with agreed definitions and owners
