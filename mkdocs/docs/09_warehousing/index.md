# Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence

The [Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW)](../glossary.md#data-warehouse-edw) serves as a central platform for reporting, analytics, and historical analysis. It brings together structured, high-quality data from multiple sources — typically operational, regulatory, and administrative — to provide a consistent foundation for decision-making.

[Business Intelligence (BI)](../glossary.md#business-intelligence-bi) tools allow staff to visualize, explore, and analyze this data in dashboards, charts, and reports. Both the EDW and BI layers depend heavily on [reference data](../glossary.md#reference-data), [data stewardship](../glossary.md#stewardship), and well-defined [data models](../glossary.md#data-modeling).

---

## Objective

Establish a trusted EDW and BI environment that enables consistent analytics, clear metric definitions, and reliable performance monitoring.

---

### Key Results

- Publish a [data mart](../glossary.md#data-mart) with conformed dimensions and summary tables  
- Launch three dashboards built from EDW data  
- Align two existing reports to [reference data](../glossary.md#reference-data) definitions  
- Assign stewards for high-visibility dashboards or KPIs  

---

## Core Processes

- [Data modeling](../glossary.md#data-modeling) for analytics use cases  
- Dashboard request intake and documentation  
- Metric definition and glossary alignment  
- [ETL](../glossary.md#etl-extract-transform-load) or [ELT](../glossary.md#elt-extract-load-transform) job monitoring  
- Report usage tracking and version control  

---

## Suggested Metrics

- Percentage of dashboards built on EDW-certified datasets  
- Number of KPIs with glossary definitions and stewards  
- Report refresh success rate  
- Average time from request to dashboard deployment
