# Design Thinking Overview

This page introduces **Design Thinking** — a human-centered, iterative approach to solving complex problems. It is widely used in product design, service innovation, digital transformation, and public sector modernization.

---

## Definition

**Design Thinking** is a structured methodology for creative problem solving. It emphasizes empathy with users, rapid prototyping, and iterative testing — enabling teams to create solutions that are desirable, feasible, and viable.

---

## Purpose

- Center problem-solving on real user needs  
- Reduce risk of delivering the wrong solution  
- Encourage experimentation and rapid iteration  
- Bridge silos through cross-functional collaboration  
- Accelerate value delivery in uncertain or evolving contexts

## Five Stages of Design Thinking

Design Thinking is typically described in five stages. While the process is not strictly linear, teams often cycle between stages as needed.

### 1. **Empathize**  
Understand users and their experiences through observation, interviews, and engagement.

### 2. **Define**  
Synthesize findings into a clear problem statement (point of view) that captures user needs.

### 3. **Ideate**  
Generate a wide range of potential solutions without judgment or bias.

### 4. **Prototype**  
Build simple, testable versions of concepts to explore and validate ideas.

### 5. **Test**  
Try out prototypes with users, gather feedback, and refine the solution.

## Common Terminology

| Term             | Definition |
|------------------|------------|
| **Empathy Map**  | A tool for visualizing user attitudes and behaviors |
| **Point of View (POV)** | A focused problem definition grounded in user needs |
| **HMW (How Might We)** | A brainstorming prompt that opens space for multiple solutions |
| **Prototype**    | A simplified version of a solution used for testing and feedback |
| **Iteration**    | A loop of continuous learning, feedback, and refinement |

## Use Cases in Utilities and Public Agencies

- Reimagining customer billing or outreach processes  
- Prototyping field worker mobile tools or dashboards  
- Improving internal workflows (e.g., service requests, asset inspections)  
- Engaging stakeholders in participatory problem-solving  
- Aligning digital services with equity, accessibility, and resilience goals

## Design Thinking vs Traditional Problem Solving

| Feature            | Design Thinking              | Traditional Planning            |
|--------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Focus              | User experience and insight   | Technical requirements and feasibility |
| Process Style      | Iterative and non-linear      | Linear and milestone-driven      |
| Risk Profile       | Early failure and learning    | Late risk discovery              |
| Collaboration      | Cross-functional, inclusive   | Role-based or hierarchical       |
| Speed              | Rapid prototyping             | Extended planning and review     |
