# Document and Content Management

[Document and Content Management](../glossary.md#document-and-content-management) governs unstructured information such as reports, SOPs, maps, permits, inspection photos, and PDFs.  
In a water utility, these materials often complement structured data by providing the operational, regulatory, or historical context behind assets and activities.

When properly managed, content becomes searchable, version-controlled, and linked to relevant datasets, improving transparency and supporting staff transitions.  
This function aligns with [data governance](../glossary.md#data-governance) and [stewardship](../glossary.md#stewardship) by assigning ownership and retention guidelines.

## Objective

Ensure critical documents are stored, searchable, governed, and linked to supporting data systems or workflows.

---

### Key Results

- Inventory 10 critical documents (e.g., permits, SOPs, internal policies)  
- Assign [data stewards](../glossary.md#data-steward) or content owners for high-value documents  
- Establish naming conventions and folder structure for shared drive or content system  
- Link at least one PDF or SOP to a dashboard, asset class, or glossary term  

---

## Core Processes

- Document intake, tagging, and review  
- Version control and access tracking  
- File naming and content metadata standards  
- Review and deprecation schedule enforcement  
- Integration of document references into dashboards or [business glossary](../glossary.md#business-glossary)

---

## Suggested Metrics

- Number of governed documents per domain  
- Percentage of critical SOPs updated in the past year  
- Average time to locate high-priority files during audit or response  
- Number of documents linked to analytics workflows
