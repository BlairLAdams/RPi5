# Document and Content Management
Document and content management addresses the governance of unstructured information â€” such as reports, SOPs, images, drawings, and contracts. In a water utility, these assets often support or contextualize structured data systems like CMMS, GIS, and LIMS. For example, an as-built drawing may explain why a pipe was rerouted, or a PDF lab report may clarify an outlier reading in the EDW. Proper content management ensures that critical documents are accessible, version-controlled, linked to the appropriate data, and retained or archived according to policy. It also helps with regulatory audits, transparency, and operational continuity.

## Objective
Ensure that essential unstructured content is properly stored, accessible, and linked to key datasets to support data context and continuity.

### Key Results
- Create an inventory of 10 critical documents (e.g., SOPs, drawings, lab reports) and store them in a managed location  
- Define file naming conventions and folder structure for new content uploads  
- Link at least two documents to related structured records (e.g., an SOP to a dataset or dashboard)  
- Document version control process and assign responsibility  

## Core Processes
- Document ingestion, review, and approval  
- Versioning and change tracking  
- Metadata tagging (e.g., document type, system, date)  
- Retention schedule enforcement  
- Linkage of content to structured data via indexes or dashboards  

## Suggested Metrics
- Percent of key datasets with supporting documents identified and linked  
- Number of documents reviewed and updated within the past 12 months  
- Time-to-retrieve requested documents during an audit or event  
- Document redundancy or duplication rate across systems
