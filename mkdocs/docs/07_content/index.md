# Document and Content Management

[Document and Content Management](../glossary.md#document-and-content-management) governs unstructured content such as reports, SOPs, drawings, PDFs, and inspection photos.  
In a water utility, these materials often provide the operational context needed to interpret [structured data](../glossary.md#data-architecture) in systems like [CMMS](../glossary.md#cmms) or [EDW](../glossary.md#data-warehouse-edw).

Effective content management ensures documents are accessible, version-controlled, and tied to relevant datasets or processes.  
It supports [governance](../glossary.md#data-governance), transparency, and long-term knowledge retention â€” especially during staff transitions or audits.

## Objective

Ensure that essential documents are properly stored, searchable, and linked to data workflows where applicable.

---

### Key Results

- Inventory and centralize 10 critical documents supporting operational or regulatory workflows  
- Define file naming conventions and storage folders for team-wide consistency  
- Link two SOPs or PDFs to dashboards or datasets via metadata or [glossary](../glossary.md#business-glossary) references  
- Document and assign responsibilities for document versioning and archival  

---

## Core Processes

- Document ingestion, review, and approval  
- Version control and file locking  
- Metadata tagging for document type, domain, and steward  
- Periodic review and update of aging content  
- Archival and [retention policy](../glossary.md#data-retention-policy) enforcement

## Suggested Metrics

- Number of linked documents per data domain  
- Average retrieval time during audits or requests  
- Frequency of document updates by team or system  
- Percentage of critical SOPs reviewed within past 12 months
