# Document and Content Management

[Document and Content Management](../glossary.md#document-and-content-management) governs unstructured content such as reports, SOPs, drawings, PDFs, and inspection photos.  
In a water utility, these materials often provide the operational context needed to interpret [structured data](../glossary.md#data-architecture) in systems like [CMMS](../glossary.md#cmms) or [EDW](../glossary.md#data-warehouse-edw).

Effective content management ensures documents are accessible, version-controlled, and tied to relevant datasets or processes.  
It supports [governance](../glossary.md#data-governance), transparency, and long-term knowledge retention — especially during staff transitions or audits.
