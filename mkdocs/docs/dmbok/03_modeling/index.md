# Data Modeling and Design

[Data Modeling](../glossary.md#data-modeling) defines how data is structured, related, and represented across systems and business processes. In a water utility, this includes defining what a “station,” “work order,” or “asset” means — and how those concepts are used across operational platforms. Models provide a shared language that supports consistency in analysis, [data quality](../glossary.md#data-quality), and reporting.

Early modeling efforts typically produce [data dictionaries](../glossary.md#data-dictionary), conceptual diagrams, and help align definitions across teams. Validated models also support [metadata](../glossary.md#metadata), [stewardship](../glossary.md#stewardship), and downstream reporting layers.

## Objective

Define and document reusable [data models](../glossary.md#data-modeling) that reflect key entities and support analytics across departments.

---

### Key Results

- Draft an entity-relationship diagram for three priority domains  
- Publish a [data dictionary](../glossary.md#data-dictionary) with field types and definitions  
- Align one shared metric across multiple departments  
- Review models with both stewards and business owners  

---

## Core Processes

- Conceptual and logical model design  
- Definition and approval of terms and relationships  
- Metadata alignment with approved terms  
- Mapping of values across [reference data](../glossary.md#reference-data)  
- Model version control and stewardship review  

---

## Suggested Metrics

- Number of reviewed and published data models  
- Percentage of dashboards linked to shared models  
- Number of harmonized definitions across departments  
- Frequency of model review or change request
