# Data Engineer Advanced Skills

A comprehensive, tagged guide with concept explanations for developing advanced skills in data engineering.

## 1. CS Fundamentals

### Basic terminal usage  
Use command-line interfaces (CLI) to navigate, run scripts, manage files, and control environments.  
**Concept:** The CLI allows powerful automation and scripting. Knowing commands like `ls`, `cd`, `grep`, and piping (`|`) unlocks Unix systems.

### Data structures & algorithms  
Understand how data is organized and how to manipulate it efficiently.  
**Concept:** Learn arrays, lists, dictionaries (hash maps), trees, and graphs. Algorithmic thinking improves performance and reduces bottlenecks in ETL pipelines.

### APIs  
Application Programming Interfaces define how programs interact.  
**Concept:** Understand how to call and parse API responses (often JSON). REST and GraphQL are dominant formats for accessing external or internal services.

### REST  
A widely used web architecture style for APIs based on stateless calls.  
**Concept:** Learn HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), status codes, and endpoints. Critical for integrating third-party and internal services.

### Structured vs unstructured data  
Differentiate data with fixed schemas (tables) vs. free-form content (logs, PDFs).  
**Concept:** ETL strategies differ based on data structure. Use schema-on-read tools (e.g., Spark) for unstructured data.

### Serialisation  
Convert data structures into a format for storage or transmission (e.g., JSON, Parquet).  
**Concept:** Learn formats like Avro, JSON, Protobuf, and Parquet. Understand trade-offs: human-readable vs efficient encoding.

### Linux  
Most data platforms run on Linux; know basic ops and scripting.  
- **CLI:** Work within the shell (bash/zsh) to manage files and processes.  
- **Vim:** Text editor commonly found on all Linux systems.  
- **Shell scripting:** Automate workflows using `.sh` files.  
- **Cronjobs:** Schedule recurring jobs using cron.  
**Concept:** Become fluent in daily terminal tasks; it's essential for debugging and automation.

### How does the computer work?  
Understand basic hardware, CPU, memory, and file I/O.  
**Concept:** Helps when tuning performance and debugging pipeline or storage latency.

### How does the Internet work?  
Understand DNS, HTTP, TCP/IP, and routing.  
**Concept:** Critical for debugging data ingestion from external APIs or services.

### Git — Version control  
Track changes, manage branches, and collaborate on code.  
**Concept:** Learn `git clone`, `commit`, `push`, `merge`, and `rebase`. Git is also used in data CI/CD workflows (e.g., dbt, Airflow DAGs).

### Math & statistics basics  
Understand probability, distributions, averages, and basic inference.  
**Concept:** Useful for quality checks, anomaly detection, and working with ML teams.

## 2. Programming Languages

### Python  
A versatile language for scripting, ETL, APIs, dataframes, and orchestration.  
**Concept:** Know `pandas`, `sqlalchemy`, `requests`, and multiprocessing. Python dominates the modern DE stack.

### Java  
Often used in enterprise tools (e.g., Hadoop, Kafka, Beam).  
**Concept:** Required to extend or debug JVM-based big data tools.

### Scala  
Functional programming language for Spark and streaming workloads.  
**Concept:** Learn immutability, map/reduce operations, and Spark transformations.

### Go  
Compiled language for building fast, concurrent systems.  
**Concept:** Some modern DE tools (e.g., Prometheus, Loki) use Go; useful for writing high-performance services.

## 3. Testing

### Unit testing  
Validate individual components of a script or module.  
**Concept:** Learn `pytest` or `unittest` in Python. Test each function with mocks and assertions.

### Integration testing  
Test how multiple components work together.  
**Concept:** Useful when testing Airflow DAGs, database connections, and API endpoints.

### Functional testing  
Verify that the system performs as expected from an end-user perspective.  
**Concept:** Applies to entire pipeline runs or API inputs/outputs.

### Property-based testing  
Test functions with a wide range of randomized inputs.  
**Concept:** Use tools like Hypothesis to ensure robustness of data transformations.

## 4. Database Fundamentals

### SQL  
The standard language for querying and manipulating structured data in relational databases.  
**Concept:** Learn `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, subqueries, window functions, and CTEs.

### Normalisation  
Organize data to eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity.  
**Concept:** Understand 1NF to 3NF and how denormalization can be used for analytics.

### ACID transactions  
Ensure that database operations are Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, and Durable.  
**Concept:** Guarantees reliability in transactional systems, crucial for OLTP.

### CAP theorem  
Describes trade-offs between Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance in distributed systems.  
**Concept:** You can only have two out of three — know what your database prioritizes.

### OLTP vs OLAP  
Distinguish between systems optimized for transactional processing vs analytical querying.  
**Concept:** OLTP (e.g., PostgreSQL) is row-oriented and normalized; OLAP (e.g., Redshift) is columnar and denormalized.

### Horizontal vs vertical scaling  
Ways to increase capacity by adding machines or resources.  
**Concept:** Horizontal scaling (sharding/distribution); vertical scaling (larger server with more RAM/CPU).

### Dimensional modeling  
Design schemas that optimize analytics performance.  
**Concept:** Use star or snowflake schemas with fact and dimension tables.

### Indexing strategies  
Improve query performance by organizing data for fast access.  
**Concept:** Learn B-tree, bitmap, and hash indexes; understand when to index and how to interpret query plans.

### Query optimization  
Tuning queries for speed and resource efficiency.  
**Concept:** Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, reduce nested queries, avoid Cartesian products, and leverage indexes.
