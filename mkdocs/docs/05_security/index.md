# Data Security

Data security protects sensitive information from unauthorized access, misuse, or loss.  
In a water utility, this includes securing SCADA telemetry, [reference data](../glossary.md#reference-data), and operational records managed in the [Enterprise Data Warehouse](../glossary.md#data-warehouse-edw).  
As integration increases across [line of business systems](../glossary.md#line-of-business-system), strong security practices are essential to reduce risk and maintain trust.

Security is more than firewalls â€” it includes [access control](../glossary.md#access-control), data classification, audit trails,  
and governance policies enforced through collaboration between IT and data stewards.

## Objective

Establish security practices that protect data confidentiality, integrity, and availability across integrated systems and storage.

---

### Key Results

- Define user roles and [access controls](../glossary.md#access-control) for core datasets  
- Enable secure authentication for shared systems (e.g., dashboards, EDW)  
- Publish data classification levels (e.g., confidential, internal, public) and handling guidelines  
- Assign security stewardship responsibilities for at least one dataset  

---

## Core Processes

- Role-based [access control](../glossary.md#access-control) provisioning  
- Audit logging and change tracking  
- Sensitive data classification  
- Integration of security reviews into [governance](../glossary.md#data-governance) workflows  
- Risk mitigation and policy exception reviews

## Suggested Metrics

- Number of datasets with role-based access policies  
- Frequency of access audits or recertifications  
- Percentage of datasets with security classification tags  
- Time to revoke access after a user role change
