# Data Security

Data security protects sensitive information from unauthorized access, misuse, or loss.  
In a water utility, this includes securing operational telemetry, [reference data](../glossary.md#reference-data), and system-generated records managed in the [Enterprise Data Warehouse](../glossary.md#data-warehouse-edw).  
Strong security practices are essential to reduce risk and maintain trust as data is shared across departments and platforms.

Security involves [access control](../glossary.md#access-control), data classification, audit trails, and [data governance](../glossary.md#data-governance) policies that are enforced consistently by stewards and IT administrators.

---

## Objective

Establish security practices that protect data confidentiality, integrity, and availability across integrated systems and storage.

---

### Key Results

- Define user roles and [access control](../glossary.md#access-control) for core datasets  
- Enable secure authentication and role alignment for dashboards and EDW  
- Publish data classification levels and handling guidelines  
- Assign security stewardship responsibilities for one or more data domains  

---

## Core Processes

- Role-based [access control](../glossary.md#access-control) provisioning  
- Audit logging and change tracking  
- Sensitive data classification and documentation  
- Security impact reviews within [governance](../glossary.md#data-governance) workflows  
- Risk mitigation and exception handling  

---

## Suggested Metrics

- Percentage of datasets with documented access controls  
- Number of audit events reviewed per quarter  
- Frequency of user access reviews or role changes  
- Coverage of data classification tagging across EDW
