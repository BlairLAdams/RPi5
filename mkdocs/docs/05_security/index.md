# Data Security
Data security protects sensitive and mission-critical information from unauthorized access, alteration, or loss. For water utilities, this includes securing SCADA telemetry, customer billing data, work orders, infrastructure maps, and employee records. As utilities move toward integrated systems and cloud-enabled analytics platforms, clear data security practices help reduce operational risk, comply with regulations, and build trust with staff and the public Security is not just an IT responsibility â€” it involves governance, access policies, auditing, and coordination between departments. For organizations early in their data modernization journey, practical steps like access control and encryption-at-rest offer meaningful risk reduction  
without heavy overhead.

## Objective
Establish baseline data security practices that protect access, ensure auditability, and reduce risk across key systems.

### Key Results
- Define user roles and access levels for EDW and connected tools  
- Enable password or key-based authentication for all remote services  
- Implement encrypted backups and confirm successful recovery  
- Document who has access to sensitive datasets and how that access is granted or revoked  

## Core Processes
- User provisioning and de-provisioning  
- Access review and recertification  
- Audit logging and incident response  
- Credential management and key rotation  
- Security policy publication and acknowledgment  

## Suggested Metrics
- Percent of datasets with access rights explicitly defined  
- Time-to-revoke access after role change or departure  
- Number of audit log entries reviewed per month  
- Frequency of access recertification across systems
