# Data Security

Data security protects sensitive information from unauthorized access, misuse, or loss.  
In a water utility, this includes securing SCADA telemetry, [reference data](../glossary.md#reference-data), and operational records managed in the [Enterprise Data Warehouse](../glossary.md#data-warehouse-edw).  
As integration increases across [line of business systems](../glossary.md#line-of-business-system), strong security practices are essential to reduce risk and maintain trust.

Security is more than firewalls — it includes [access control](../glossary.md#access-control), data classification, audit trails,  
and governance policies enforced through collaboration between IT and data stewards.
