# Data Quality

[Data Quality](../glossary.md#data-quality) ensures that data is accurate, complete, timely, and consistent enough to support operations, analysis, and reporting.  
In a water utility, poor data quality might lead to missed maintenance, incorrect regulatory reporting, or misinformed capital planning.  
Effective data quality programs rely on [data stewardship](../glossary.md#stewardship), well-defined [validation rules](../glossary.md#validation-rule),  
and clear communication between IT, engineering, operations, and compliance teams.

Quality issues should be tracked, prioritized, and resolved — not just discovered after the fact. Over time, mature utilities use [metrics](../glossary.md#metrics)  
and [critical data elements](../glossary.md#critical-data-element) to focus their efforts and measure impact.
