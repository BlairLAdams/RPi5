# Data Quality

[Data Quality](../glossary.md#data-quality) ensures that data is accurate, complete, timely, and consistent enough to support operations, reporting, and decision-making. In a water utility, poor data quality can lead to incorrect work orders, delayed compliance reports, or misinformed capital investments. A proactive quality program helps identify and fix issues early â€” often by combining [stewardship](../glossary.md#stewardship), monitoring, and feedback loops.

Data quality also plays a key role in adoption. When staff trust the data, they use it more consistently and effectively.

## Objective

Monitor and improve [data quality](../glossary.md#data-quality) by defining rules, assigning stewards, and resolving issues in a transparent, documented way.

---

### Key Results

- Define [validation rules](../glossary.md#validation-rule) for three datasets (e.g., no missing runtimes, valid codes)  
- Assign [data stewards](../glossary.md#data-steward) to monitor and respond to flagged issues  
- Create a backlog of known issues with status and owner  
- Implement anomaly checks on at least one time-series dataset  

---

## Core Processes

- [Data profiling](../glossary.md#data-profiling) and rule creation  
- Issue triage, root cause analysis, and correction  
- Governance review for systemic problems  
- Feedback loops with data producers and stewards  
- Documentation and revision of [validation rules](../glossary.md#validation-rule)  

---

## Suggested Metrics

- Percentage of records passing validation rules  
- Number of unresolved issues over 30 days old  
- Time-to-resolve for high-priority errors  
- Data quality score by table, steward, or refresh
