# Data Quality

[Data Quality](../glossary.md#data-quality) ensures that data is accurate, complete, timely, and consistent enough to support operations, analysis, and reporting.  
In a water utility, poor data quality might lead to missed maintenance, incorrect regulatory reporting, or misinformed capital planning.  
Effective data quality programs rely on [data stewardship](../glossary.md#stewardship), well-defined [validation rules](../glossary.md#validation-rule),  
and clear communication between IT, engineering, operations, and compliance teams.

Quality issues should be tracked, prioritized, and resolved â€” not just discovered after the fact. Over time, mature utilities use [metrics](../glossary.md#metrics)  
and [critical data elements](../glossary.md#critical-data-element) to focus their efforts and measure impact.

## Objective

Improve the reliability of core datasets by establishing roles, rules, and workflows for ongoing [data quality](../glossary.md#data-quality) monitoring and improvement.

---

### Key Results

- Define [validation rules](../glossary.md#validation-rule) for three datasets (e.g., no null runtimes, valid facility codes)  
- Assign [data stewards](../glossary.md#data-steward) to monitor and triage quality issues  
- Create a backlog of known issues with resolution status  
- Implement basic anomaly checks on one time-series dataset  

---

## Core Processes

- [Data profiling](../glossary.md#data-profiling) and issue identification  
- Rule-based monitoring and alerting  
- Quality issue triage and assignment  
- Resolution tracking and root cause analysis  
- Coordination with [governance](../glossary.md#data-governance) and source system teams  

---

## Suggested Metrics

- Percentage of records passing validation rules  
- Number of open vs. resolved quality issues  
- Time-to-resolve for critical issues  
- Frequency of repeated rule violations by table
