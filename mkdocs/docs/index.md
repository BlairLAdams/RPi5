# Welcome to the RPi5 Open Source Analytics Platform Data Management Catalog

This site provides a structured, user-friendly introduction to the key disciplines of data management, based on the **DMBOK (Data Management Body of Knowledge)**.

It is designed as a living reference for practitioners, stewards, and curious teams who want to better understand how data governance, quality, architecture, metadata, and integration work together in a modern data ecosystem.

Each section corresponds to a core DMBOK knowledge area. Start wherever your current data challenges live — or explore from the top down.

> If you’re not sure where to begin, [Data Governance](01_governance/index.md) is the recommended first stop.
