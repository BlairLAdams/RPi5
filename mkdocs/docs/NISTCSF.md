# NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) Guide

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) provides a flexible, repeatable, and cost-effective approach for managing cybersecurity risk. It is widely adopted in critical infrastructure, utilities, and IT/OT environments.

Originally published by NIST in 2014 and updated in 2018 (v1.1) and 2024 (v2.0), the CSF consists of five **Core Functions**, further organized into **Categories** and **Subcategories**.

## üî∑ CSF Core Functions Overview

| Function   | Purpose                                       |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Identify**   | Understand organizational context, risk, and assets |
| **Protect**    | Implement safeguards to ensure service delivery     |
| **Detect**     | Discover cybersecurity events in time               |
| **Respond**    | Take action during or after a detected event        |
| **Recover**    | Restore capabilities and services after disruption  |

## üìä Implementation Tiers

Tiers describe how an organization manages cybersecurity risk. They are not maturity levels but help assess current capabilities.

| Tier | Description                                 |
|------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1    | **Partial** ‚Äì Ad hoc, reactive              |
| 2    | **Risk Informed** ‚Äì Some risk processes exist|
| 3    | **Repeatable** ‚Äì Formalized and consistent  |
| 4    | **Adaptive** ‚Äì Continuous improvement based on lessons learned |
