# Reference and Master Data

[Reference and Master Data](../glossary.md#master-data) represent stable, shared values used across multiple systems and departments.  
In a water utility, this may include analyte codes, facility IDs, pipe material types, pressure zones, or asset classifications.  
These values must be consistent across [line of business systems](../glossary.md#line-of-business-system) such as [SCADA](../glossary.md#scada), [CMMS](../glossary.md#cmms), [GIS](../glossary.md#gis), and billing.

Managing [reference data](../glossary.md#reference-data) involves publishing standards, assigning stewards, and enforcing version control.  
[Master data](../glossary.md#master-data) often maps to key identifiers like location, asset, or customer, and typically has a designated [system of record](../glossary.md#system-of-record).
