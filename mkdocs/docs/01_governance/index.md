# Data Governance
Data governance provides the foundation for treating data as a strategic, shared asset across a water utility. It defines how decisions about data are made, who is accountable for its accuracy and use, and what policies guide its management. In utilities beginning to centralize data through an Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW), governance is often the first step toward sustainable digital practices. By identifying data stewards, clarifying responsibilities, and creating a shared vision, data governance aligns operations, planning, and compliance needs under a unified framework that can grow with the organization.

## Objective
Establish foundational data governance roles, policies, and processes to support the launch and sustainability of the utilityâ€™s EDW.

### Key Results
- Assign stewards for three initial datasets (e.g., asset registry, pump runtimes, work orders)  
- Approve a one-page data governance charter  
- Launch a quarterly data governance working group meeting with notes and participation tracking  
- Identify executive sponsor and appoint a lead data steward  

## Core Processes
- Steward nomination and onboarding  
- Data issue logging and escalation  
- Charter approval and policy versioning  
- Interdepartmental data decision review  
- Documentation of data ownership and access policies  

## Suggested Metrics
- Percent of core datasets with a named steward  
- Number of data issues resolved through governance workflow  
- Charter review frequency (e.g., annually)  
- Meeting participation rate among stakeholder departments
