# Data Governance

[Data Governance](../glossary.md#data-governance) provides the foundation for treating data as a strategic, shared asset across a water utility.  
It defines how decisions about data are made, who is accountable for its accuracy and use, and what policies guide its management.  
In utilities beginning to centralize data through an [Enterprise Data Warehouse](../glossary.md#data-warehouse-edw), governance is often the first step toward sustainable digital practices.  
By identifying [Data Stewards](../glossary.md#data-steward), clarifying responsibilities, and creating a shared vision, data governance aligns operations, planning, and compliance needs  
under a unified framework that can grow with the organization.

## Objective

Establish foundational [data governance](../glossary.md#data-governance) roles, policies, and processes to support the launch and sustainability of the utilityâ€™s EDW.

---

### Key Results

- Assign [Data Stewards](../glossary.md#data-steward) for three initial datasets (e.g., asset registry, pump runtimes, work orders)  
- Approve a one-page data governance charter  
- Launch a quarterly [Governance Committee](../glossary.md#governance-committee) meeting with notes and participation tracking  
- Identify executive sponsor and appoint a lead data steward  

---

## Core Processes

- Steward nomination and onboarding  
- Data issue logging and escalation  
- Charter approval and policy versioning  
- Interdepartmental [Data Ownership](../glossary.md#data-owner) and decision review  
- Documentation of access policies and [System of Record](../glossary.md#system-of-record) assignments

## Suggested Metrics

- Percent of core datasets with a named [Data Steward](../glossary.md#data-steward)  
- Number of data issues resolved through [governance](../glossary.md#data-governance) workflow  
- Charter review frequency (e.g., annually)  
- Meeting participation rate among stakeholder departments
