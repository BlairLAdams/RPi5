# Data Governance

[Data Governance](../glossary.md#data-governance) provides the foundation for treating data as a strategic, shared asset across a water utility.  
It defines how decisions about data are made, who is accountable for its accuracy and use, and what policies guide its management.  
In utilities beginning to centralize data through an [Enterprise Data Warehouse](../glossary.md#data-warehouse-edw), governance is often the first step toward sustainable digital practices.  
By identifying [Data Stewards](../glossary.md#data-steward), clarifying responsibilities, and creating a shared vision, data governance aligns operations, planning, and compliance needs  
under a unified framework that can grow with the organization.
