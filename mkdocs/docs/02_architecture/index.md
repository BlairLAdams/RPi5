# Data Architecture
Data architecture defines the blueprint for how data is structured, stored, integrated, and delivered across systems. In a water utility, it ensures that operational systems like SCADA, GIS, CMMS, and LIMS can interoperate cleanly with enterprise tools like the EDW, BI dashboards, and regulatory reporting platforms. Architecture decisions clarify where master data resides, how data flows between systems, and what formats and standards are used. For organizations beginning to centralize analytics and reporting, data architecture provides a scalable, intentional design to reduce duplication, ensure performance, and support future growth.

## Objective
Design and document a scalable data architecture to support integration, accessibility, and trust in the utility's core data assets.

### Key Results
- Create a current-state architecture diagram (source systems, ETL pipelines, data consumers)  
- Identify master system of record for 3 core domains (e.g., GIS = asset registry)  
- Document at least one planned data flow per system (e.g., SCADA to EDW)  
- Publish a data system inventory with owners and refresh frequencies  

## Core Processes
- Architecture design and stakeholder validation  
- Master data source designation and documentation  
- Interface and data pipeline mapping  
- Metadata tagging of system boundaries and interfaces  
- Integration approval and version control process  

## Suggested Metrics
- Percent of core systems documented in architecture diagram  
- Number of systems with defined source-of-truth per domain  
- Time to update architecture documentation after system changes  
- Rate of redundant data store reduction (e.g., spreadsheets replaced by EDW)
