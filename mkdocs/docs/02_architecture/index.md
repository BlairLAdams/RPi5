# Data Architecture

[Data Architecture](../glossary.md#data-architecture) defines the blueprint for how data is structured, stored, and integrated across systems.  
In a water utility, this includes designing how data flows between [line of business systems](../glossary.md#line-of-business-system) such as [CMMS](../glossary.md#cmms), [SCADA](../glossary.md#scada), and [GIS](../glossary.md#gis),  
and how it's centralized into an [Enterprise Data Warehouse](../glossary.md#data-warehouse-edw). Architecture decisions clarify the [system of record](../glossary.md#system-of-record) for key data domains,  
standardize [reference data](../glossary.md#reference-data), and document data movement through [pipelines](../glossary.md#data-pipeline).
