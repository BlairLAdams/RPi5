# Data Storage and Operations

Data storage and operations ensure that data remains accessible, reliable, and protected over time.  
In a water utility, this includes storing structured data from [line of business systems](../glossary.md#line-of-business-system) and [reference data](../glossary.md#reference-data),  
ensuring [backups](../glossary.md#archiving) are in place, and managing data lifecycle practices like [retention](../glossary.md#data-retention-policy) and [archiving](../glossary.md#archiving).

For organizations adopting an [Enterprise Data Warehouse](../glossary.md#data-warehouse-edw),  
storage operations also include tracking [data pipelines](../glossary.md#data-pipeline), [metadata](../glossary.md#metadata), and integration refreshes.
