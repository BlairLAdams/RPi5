# Data Storage and Operations

Data storage and operations ensure that data remains accessible, reliable, and protected over time.  
In a water utility, this includes storing structured data from [line of business systems](../glossary.md#line-of-business-system) and [reference data](../glossary.md#reference-data),  
ensuring [backups](../glossary.md#archiving) are in place, and managing data lifecycle practices like [retention](../glossary.md#data-retention-policy) and [archiving](../glossary.md#archiving).

For organizations adopting an [Enterprise Data Warehouse](../glossary.md#data-warehouse-edw),  
storage operations also include tracking [data pipelines](../glossary.md#data-pipeline), [metadata](../glossary.md#metadata), and integration refreshes.

## Objective

Implement resilient, policy-driven [data storage](../glossary.md#data-architecture) to support analytics, governance, and regulatory continuity.

---

### Key Results

- Define [retention policies](../glossary.md#data-retention-policy) for three high-value datasets  
- Establish automated backups and test recovery for one dataset  
- Document a storage and archiving policy reviewed by stewards  
- Classify datasets by [criticality](../glossary.md#critical-data-element) and storage tier  

---

## Core Processes

- Backup creation and validation  
- Storage tier classification and [archiving](../glossary.md#archiving)  
- Retention policy enforcement  
- Monitoring data volume growth and access frequency  
- Periodic restore testing for continuity  

---

## Suggested Metrics

- Recovery time for most critical dataset  
- Share of datasets covered by [retention policy](../glossary.md#data-retention-policy)  
- Number of backup failures in last 30 days  
- Storage growth rate by system or domain
