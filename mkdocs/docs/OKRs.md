# Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)

This page introduces the OKR (Objectives and Key Results) framework, widely used to align organizational goals with measurable outcomes. It is increasingly applied in data governance, digital transformation, and performance management programs.

---

## Definition

**OKRs** are a goal-setting framework used to define clear, inspirational objectives and measurable results. Each **Objective** describes what is to be achieved, and each **Key Result** explains how progress will be measured.

---

## Purpose

- Align teams around shared, high-impact goals  
- Translate vision and strategy into execution  
- Create transparency across departments and functions  
- Focus effort on measurable outcomes, not activities  
- Improve accountability and adaptability

---

## Components of an OKR

### Objective  
- Qualitative, time-bound statement of ambition  
- Should be inspirational and directional  
- Answers: *What do we want to achieve?*

*Example:*  
“Improve data transparency and trust across the organization”

### Key Results  
- Quantitative measures of progress toward the objective  
- Must be time-bound, specific, and outcome-based  
- Answers: *How will we know we’ve achieved it?*

*Example Key Results:*  
- “Catalog 100% of Tier 1 datasets in the glossary by Q2”  
- “Resolve 90% of open data quality issues in under 30 days”  
- “Increase self-service report usage by 40% over baseline”

## OKRs vs KPIs

| Feature         | OKR                      | KPI                        |
|----------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Purpose         | Drive strategic change    | Monitor ongoing performance |
| Time Horizon    | Quarterly or annual       | Continuous or rolling       |
| Outcome Focus   | Transformational          | Operational                 |
| Owner Type      | Cross-functional teams    | Specific business units     |
| Format          | Objective + Key Results   | Metric + Target             |

---

## Best Practices

- Set no more than 3–5 OKRs per team per cycle  
- Use stretch goals, but keep Key Results achievable  
- Focus on outcomes, not tasks or initiatives  
- Score Key Results at the end of each cycle (0.0–1.0 scale or %)  
- Review progress regularly and adjust based on learning

---

## Utility & Governance Use Cases

- Align IT, operations, and finance around shared data initiatives  
- Track progress in governance maturity or data quality  
- Embed OKRs into digital transformation or AMI/SCADA modernization programs  
- Use OKRs to frame regulatory goals, such as transparency or compliance

---

## Example OKRs

**Objective:**  
Strengthen trust in operational data across the utility

**Key Results:**  
- Assign data owners to 100% of Tier 1 systems by Q2  
- Launch self-service glossary and stewardship workflow by Q3  
- Reduce duplicate customer records by 80%  
- Resolve 95% of quality issues within SLA by year-end

## Related Frameworks

- OKRs often work alongside:
  - KPIs (for baseline monitoring)
  - DMBOK (as a strategic guide)
  - Agile sprint goals and PI Objectives
  - Risk and audit frameworks (e.g., NIST, COSO)
