# OKR Companion Guide for Program Managers (Utilities & Technical Delivery Teams)

This guide adapts the OKR framework for use in utility agencies, municipal departments, and infrastructure-focused program teams. It supports alignment across strategic goals, capital planning, IT systems integration, and field operations.

---

## 🎯 Objective Design (Utility & Infrastructure Context)

Objectives should be:

- **Strategic**: Tied to major initiatives like capital planning, regulatory compliance, customer service, or digital modernization.
- **Time-bound**: Typically set quarterly or aligned with fiscal-year milestones.
- **Team-driven**: Developed collaboratively with SMEs, planners, and operational leads.

> **Example Objective:**  
> Improve readiness and coordination across CIP portfolio delivery and regulatory reporting.

---

## 📏 Key Results in Practice

Key Results should:

- Measure progress on initiatives or policy outcomes (not tasks)
- Reflect cross-functional coordination where applicable
- Be tracked using real data (e.g., GIS, WIMS, CMMS, ERP)

> **Example Key Results for Above Objective:**  
> - 90% of FY24 CIP projects assigned risk ratings and mitigation plans  
> - Complete Phase 1 regulatory reporting dashboard in Power BI by Q2  
> - Reduce average time to update CIP project status from 12 days to 3 days

## 📋 Common Themes for Utility-Focused OKRs

| Theme | Sample Objectives |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Regulatory Compliance** | Streamline regulatory submittals across departments |
| **Asset Management** | Expand lifecycle cost analysis into annual budgeting |
| **Customer Service** | Improve call center and billing inquiry resolution time |
| **Data Integration** | Build cross-platform data pipelines (GIS + WIMS + SCADA) |
| **Field Ops Modernization** | Deploy mobile CMMS forms to 80% of field teams |
| **Equity & Access** | Incorporate equity metrics into water conservation planning |

## 🔄 Governance Integration

Use OKRs to complement and structure:

- **Quarterly OKR Reviews** → Sync with capital planning or strategic initiative meetings  
- **Monthly Check-Ins** → Layer into PMO or IT steering committee updates  
- **Progress Reporting** → Embed OKRs into dashboards (e.g., Power BI, Azure DevOps, MS Planner)

> Align with IT governance or departmental leadership review cycles for maximum impact.
