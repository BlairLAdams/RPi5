# Data Integration and Interoperability

[Data Integration](../glossary.md#data-integration) brings together data from multiple systems to form a consistent, unified view.  
In a water utility, this may include integrating [SCADA](../glossary.md#scada) data with [CMMS](../glossary.md#cmms) work orders or combining [reference data](../glossary.md#reference-data) across departments.  
Interoperability ensures that systems can exchange data reliably and on schedule.

An integrated architecture supports [data quality](../glossary.md#data-quality), [metadata](../glossary.md#metadata), and analytics by making data more accessible and standardized.  
The early focus is on establishing [data pipelines](../glossary.md#data-pipeline) that are documented, monitored, and stewarded.

## Objective

Implement well-documented and monitored [data pipelines](../glossary.md#data-pipeline) that connect source systems to trusted analytics environments.

---

### Key Results

- Configure two initial integrations with working [ELT](../glossary.md#elt-extract-load-transform) or [ETL](../glossary.md#etl-extract-transform-load) pipelines  
- Document data refresh frequency and transformation logic for each pipeline  
- Resolve identifier mismatches across [reference data](../glossary.md#reference-data) (e.g., facility codes)  
- Assign data stewards to manage pipeline handoffs and exceptions  

---

## Core Processes

- Source system discovery and credential management  
- Pipeline configuration, testing, and automation  
- Identifier mapping and reconciliation  
- Data format and unit standardization  
- Integration documentation with [metadata](../glossary.md#metadata) and steward contact info  

---

## Suggested Metrics

- Number of active [data pipelines](../glossary.md#data-pipeline)  
- Percentage of pipelines with up-to-date documentation  
- Data freshness (lag time from source to EDW)  
- Frequency of pipeline failures or exceptions
