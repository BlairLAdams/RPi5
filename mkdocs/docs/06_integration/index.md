# Data Integration and Interoperability
Data integration is the process of combining data from different systems to create a unified, consistent view. For water utilities, this might involve bringing together asset information from GIS, maintenance history from CMMS, sensor readings from SCADA, and lab results from LIMS to support cross-functional reporting, compliance, or decision support. Interoperability goes further by enabling systems to exchange data and operate together smoothly in real time or via automated batch processes. A successful EDW depends on well-defined, reliable integration â€” starting with a few high-value data flows, then scaling over time.

## Objective
Establish reliable, well-documented pipelines that connect key systems to the EDW and enable analytics across operational silos.

### Key Results
- Build and schedule at least two working extract-load scripts from SCADA and CMMS  
- Define a common date-time and unit format across incoming sources  
- Document integration logic and update schedule in MkDocs or a shared repo  
- Identify and resolve at least one source system conflict (e.g., mismatched asset IDs between GIS and CMMS)

## Core Processes
- Source system discovery and access setup  
- ETL/ELT job configuration and testing  
- Format and unit normalization  
- Integration job monitoring and logging  
- Cross-system identifier mapping and reconciliation  

## Suggested Metrics
- Number of source systems actively feeding the EDW  
- Percent of ETL jobs running on schedule without failure  
- Data freshness lag (e.g., time between event and EDW arrival)  
- Count of unresolved integration conflicts or duplicates
