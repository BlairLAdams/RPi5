# Data Integration and Interoperability

[Data Integration](../glossary.md#data-integration) connects data across systems to provide a unified, consistent view of operations and performance.  
In a water utility, this often means pulling data from field systems, work management tools, or lab results into an [Enterprise Data Warehouse](../glossary.md#data-warehouse-edw) for analysis and reporting.  
Good integration practices ensure data is accurate, up-to-date, and traceable to its [system of record](../glossary.md#system-of-record).

As more systems connect, [metadata](../glossary.md#metadata) and [data quality](../glossary.md#data-quality) become central to understanding how values relate,  
while stewards and architects play a key role in defining and reviewing [data pipelines](../glossary.md#data-pipeline).

---

## Objective

Deploy stewarded [data pipelines](../glossary.md#data-pipeline) and integration logic that connects operational data to analytics environments in a transparent and traceable way.

---

### Key Results

- Deploy and document two active integrations with refresh schedules  
- Assign stewards to monitor integration inputs and exceptions  
- Publish one flow diagram showing end-to-end movement from source to EDW  
- Resolve one field-level inconsistency using [reference data](../glossary.md#reference-data)

---

## Core Processes

- Source system analysis and data mapping  
- [Metadata](../glossary.md#metadata) capture for integrated datasets  
- Pipeline failure monitoring and alerting  
- Change control for schema and format shifts  
- Review of pipeline refresh timing and system impacts  

---

## Suggested Metrics

- Number of active [data pipelines](../glossary.md#data-pipeline) feeding the EDW  
- Percentage of pipelines with stewards assigned  
- Time-to-detect and resolve pipeline errors  
- Data freshness (delay from source to EDW availability)
