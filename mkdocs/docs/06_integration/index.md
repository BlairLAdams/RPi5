# Data Integration and Interoperability

[Data Integration](../glossary.md#data-integration) brings together data from multiple systems to form a consistent, unified view.  
In a water utility, this may include integrating [SCADA](../glossary.md#scada) data with [CMMS](../glossary.md#cmms) work orders or combining [reference data](../glossary.md#reference-data) across departments.  
Interoperability ensures that systems can exchange data reliably and on schedule.

An integrated architecture supports [data quality](../glossary.md#data-quality), [metadata](../glossary.md#metadata), and analytics by making data more accessible and standardized.  
The early focus is on establishing [data pipelines](../glossary.md#data-pipeline) that are documented, monitored, and stewarded.
