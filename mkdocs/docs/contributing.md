# Contributing to This Site
This site is a living knowledge base for our utility’s data management program, aligned to the DMBOK framework and tailored for our specific tools and systems.

We welcome contributions from team members who work with GIS, CMMS, SCADA, LIMS, BI tools, or any other system that generates or uses data.

## How to Contribute
You can help by:
- Improving explanations or definitions in existing pages  
- Adding examples from your team’s experience  
- Updating metrics, owners, or processes as they evolve  
- Flagging gaps, duplications, or outdated content  
- Suggesting new pages (e.g., FAQ, glossary terms, tool integration)

## Where to Edit
If you're comfortable using Git and Markdown:
1. Clone or pull the repository from GitHub  
2. Make edits inside the `docs/` folder  
3. Commit with a message like `Update metadata processes`  
4. Push your changes (they’ll appear on [https://mkdocs.hoveto.ca](https://mkdocs.hoveto.ca))

If you're unsure how to do this, contact a data steward or the EDW team — we'll help you submit your edits.

## Editorial Guidelines
- Use plain, beginner-friendly language  
- Prefer practical examples over abstract theory  
- Keep sections short and scannable — bullets are great  
- Use the existing DMBOK section structure when possible
