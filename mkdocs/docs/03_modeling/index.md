# Data Modeling and Design

[Data Modeling](../glossary.md#data-modeling) defines how data is structured, related, and represented across systems and business processes.  
In a water utility, this includes defining what a “station,” “work order,” or “asset” means — and how those concepts relate across [CMMS](../glossary.md#cmms), [SCADA](../glossary.md#scada), and other [line of business systems](../glossary.md#line-of-business-system).  
Models provide a shared language that supports consistency in analysis, [data quality](../glossary.md#data-quality), and reporting.

Early modeling efforts typically produce [data dictionaries](../glossary.md#data-dictionary), conceptual diagrams, and help align definitions across teams.  
Validated models also support [metadata](../glossary.md#metadata), [stewardship](../glossary.md#stewardship), and downstream [data marts](../glossary.md#data-mart).

## Objective

Define and document reusable [data models](../glossary.md#data-modeling) that reflect key entities and support analytics across departments.

---

### Key Results

- Draft an entity-relationship diagram for three priority domains  
- Publish a [data dictionary](../glossary.md#data-dictionary) with field types and definitions  
- Align one shared metric across multiple departments (e.g., downtime or repair backlog)  
- Review models with both stewards and system owners  

---

## Core Processes

- Conceptual and logical model design  
- Definition and approval of terms and relationships  
- Metadata and glossary linkage  
- Crosswalk creation for [reference data](../glossary.md#reference-data) and codes  
- Model version control

---

## Suggested Metrics

- Number of reviewed and published data models  
- Coverage of EDW tables linked to approved models  
- Count of definitions reused across dashboards  
- Frequency of model review or updates
