# Data Modeling and Design

[Data Modeling](../glossary.md#data-modeling) defines how data is structured, related, and represented across systems and business processes.  
In a water utility, this includes defining what a “station,” “work order,” or “asset” means — and how those concepts relate across [CMMS](../glossary.md#cmms), [SCADA](../glossary.md#scada), and other [line of business systems](../glossary.md#line-of-business-system).  
Models provide a shared language that supports consistency in analysis, [data quality](../glossary.md#data-quality), and reporting.

Early modeling efforts typically produce [data dictionaries](../glossary.md#data-dictionary), conceptual diagrams, and help align definitions across teams.  
Validated models also support [metadata](../glossary.md#metadata), [stewardship](../glossary.md#stewardship), and downstream [data marts](../glossary.md#data-mart).
