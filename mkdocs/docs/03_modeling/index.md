# Data Modeling and Design
Data modeling defines how data is structured, related, and represented across systems and business processes. In a water utility, this includes defining what an “asset,” “station,” or “work order” means — and how those concepts relate across GIS, CMMS, SCADA, and finance systems. Models provide a shared language for analysts, engineers, and operators, reducing confusion and enabling consistent reporting, analytics, and decision-making. Early-stage data modeling focuses on understanding core entities and relationships and making those models reusable across tools like the EDW, dashboards, and planning systems. Good models also enable scalability and avoid downstream conflicts from inconsistent field definitions or data duplication.

## Objective
Define and document clear, reusable data models that reflect key business entities and support reliable analytics.

### Key Results
- Create a conceptual entity-relationship diagram for three core domains (e.g., stations, work orders, assets)  
- Publish definitions and data types for 10 commonly used fields  
- Align one reporting metric (e.g., downtime) across three departments  
- Review and validate models with both technical and operational users  

## Core Processes
- Conceptual and logical model design  
- Model review and stakeholder sign-off  
- Field-level data dictionary creation  
- Alignment of physical schema with reporting needs  
- Model change control and versioning process  

## Suggested Metrics
- Numner of models published and reviewed  
- Percent of dashboards backed by approved data models  
- Number of conflicting field definitions resolved  
- Frequency of model reviews and updates
