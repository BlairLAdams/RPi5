# Metadata Management

[Metadata](../glossary.md#metadata) describes data’s origin, meaning, format, steward, and update schedule.  
In a water utility, it helps teams understand what a field like “runtime hours” or “asset status” means — and where it comes from.  
Strong metadata practices enable [data stewardship](../glossary.md#stewardship), [data quality](../glossary.md#data-quality), and [self-service analytics](../glossary.md#data-literacy)  
by giving users visibility into the structure, source, and purpose of datasets.

Metadata is captured in tools such as [data dictionaries](../glossary.md#data-dictionary), [business glossaries](../glossary.md#business-glossary),  
and catalog indexes of [data pipelines](../glossary.md#data-pipeline) and table owners.
