# Metadata Management

[Metadata](../glossary.md#metadata) describes the structure, meaning, source, stewardship, and lifecycle of data. In a water utility, it helps teams understand what a field like “runtime hours” means, who owns it, and when it was last updated — providing the context behind every dataset. Strong metadata practices support [data stewardship](../glossary.md#stewardship), enable [data governance](../glossary.md#data-governance), and reduce onboarding time for new analysts or engineers.

Metadata may include field descriptions, data dictionaries, [business glossary](../glossary.md#business-glossary) terms, [data pipeline](../glossary.md#data-pipeline) refresh schedules, and source-to-target documentation.

## Objective

Document and publish [metadata](../glossary.md#metadata) for priority datasets to support transparency, trust, and self-service analytics.

---

### Key Results

- Publish metadata for 10 EDW tables, including owner, refresh timing, and descriptions  
- Define 15 key business terms in a shared [business glossary](../glossary.md#business-glossary)  
- Tag 5 datasets with criticality and [system of record](../glossary.md#system-of-record) status  
- Assign metadata stewardship responsibilities  

---

## Core Processes

- Metadata capture during ingestion and modeling  
- [Data dictionary](../glossary.md#data-dictionary) and glossary publishing  
- Field-level tagging with source system and steward  
- Change tracking for schema and pipeline metadata  
- Stewardship review and documentation update cycles  

---

## Suggested Metrics

- Percentage of EDW tables with complete [metadata](../glossary.md#metadata)  
- Number of business glossary terms with steward and approval  
- Metadata search activity or pageviews  
- Frequency of metadata updates vs. data refresh schedule
