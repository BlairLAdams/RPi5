# Metadata Management

[Metadata](../glossary.md#metadata) describes data’s origin, meaning, format, steward, and update schedule.  
In a water utility, it helps teams understand what a field like “runtime hours” or “asset status” means — and where it comes from.  
Strong metadata practices enable [data stewardship](../glossary.md#stewardship), [data quality](../glossary.md#data-quality), and [self-service analytics](../glossary.md#data-literacy)  
by giving users visibility into the structure, source, and purpose of datasets.

Metadata is captured in tools such as [data dictionaries](../glossary.md#data-dictionary), [business glossaries](../glossary.md#business-glossary),  
and catalog indexes of [data pipelines](../glossary.md#data-pipeline) and table owners.

## Objective

Maintain useful, searchable [metadata](../glossary.md#metadata) for key datasets to support transparency, ownership, and effective data use.

---

### Key Results

- Publish metadata for 10 key EDW tables including steward, refresh date, and descriptions  
- Define 15 business terms in a shared [business glossary](../glossary.md#business-glossary)  
- Link [data pipelines](../glossary.md#data-pipeline) to source systems and update schedules  
- Assign metadata curation responsibilities to [data stewards](../glossary.md#data-steward) or system owners  

---

## Core Processes

- Metadata capture during ETL, modeling, and publication  
- Glossary maintenance and version control  
- Metadata publishing (e.g., in GitHub, MkDocs, dbt docs)  
- [Lineage](../glossary.md#data-lineage) and source system traceability  
- Metadata change review by [stewards](../glossary.md#data-steward)  

---

## Suggested Metrics

- Proportion of EDW tables with complete [metadata](../glossary.md#metadata)  
- Number of glossary terms with steward and approval  
- Metadata update frequency vs. actual data refresh  
- Metadata search frequency by users
