# Metadata Management
Metadata is the data about your data — it describes where the data came from, what it means, how it's used, and who owns it. In a water utility context, metadata helps staff understand fields like “station ID,” “runtime hours,” or “asset status” without guessing. It also enables traceability, stewardship, and consistent reuse of data across analytics, compliance, and operational workflows. A strong metadata practice provides searchable documentation, aligns definitions across systems, and connects users to the context behind dashboards, reports, and source tables.

## Objective
Document and maintain metadata for core datasets to improve transparency, data literacy, and responsible reuse.

### Key Results
- Publish metadata for 10 key tables or views in the EDW (source, steward, description, last update)  
- Create a data glossary with at least 15 business terms used in dashboards and reports  
- Tag each published dataset with domain, owner, and update frequency  
- Link at least one table or model diagram to MkDocs or a shared metadata viewer  

## Core Processes
- Metadata capture during ETL/modeling  
- Glossary and business term maintenance  
- Stewardship metadata collection and display  
- Metadata publishing (e.g., dbt docs, MkDocs, Git)  
- Metadata review and versioning cadence  

## Suggested Metrics
- Percont of EDW tables with complete metadata entries  
- Number of glossary terms with owner and definition  
- Metadata update frequency vs actual data refresh  
- Search/query rate of metadata by internal users
