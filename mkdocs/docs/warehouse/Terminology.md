# Vision to Metrics

This page defines and distinguishes between performance terms used in data governance, OKRs, and operational monitoring, grouped by **strategic** and **tactical** function.

---

## Strategic Layer: Vision, Goals, and Outcomes

### Vision

A long-term aspirational statement defining what the organization ultimately seeks to achieve.  
*Example:* “To deliver clean, resilient water services for future generations.”

### Mission

The organization’s core purpose and guiding philosophy.  
*Example:* “To operate and maintain water infrastructure that protects public health, meets regulatory requirements, and delivers exceptional value to our community.”

### North Star Objective

A unifying, long-range goal that connects all teams and initiatives.  
*Example:* “Build a data-driven utility that empowers transparent decision-making, proactive asset management, and exceptional service delivery.”

### Objectives (in OKRs)

Aspirational, qualitative statements of **what** we want to achieve.

**Characteristics:**

- Time-bound (quarterly or annual)
- Aligned with mission
- Inspirational, not numerical
- Supported by Key Results

*Examples:*

- “Improve system reliability across all treatment facilities”
- “Accelerate digital modernization of field operations”

### Key Results

Measurable, time-bound outcomes that define success for an Objective.

**Characteristics:**

- Quantitative
- Outcome-focused
- Time-boxed and scored

*Examples:*

- “Reduce unplanned downtime by 50% by end of Q3”
- “Digitize 100% of field forms by Q4”

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

High-priority metrics used to evaluate performance toward organizational goals.

**Characteristics:**

- Tied to strategic priorities
- Have thresholds or targets
- Featured in dashboards

*Examples:*

- Average time to repair (< 24 hrs)
- Water loss percentage (< 10%)
- Customer satisfaction (> 90%)

## Tactical Layer: Data Inputs and Monitoring Tools

### Metrics

Quantitative values used to monitor status of processes or systems.

**Characteristics:**

- Descriptive
- Operational or strategic
- Collected continuously

*Examples:*

- Gallons treated per day
- Service requests received
- Page load time

### Measures

The smallest units of quantifiable observation. Often inputs to metrics and KPIs.

**Characteristics:**

- Fine-grained
- Used in calculations
- Require context to be meaningful

*Examples:*

- Number of outages
- Uptime hours
- Cost per treatment unit

| Term            | Layer      | Granularity | Goal Link     | Example                                     |
|------------------|------------|-------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Vision**       | Strategic  | N/A         | Aspirational  | “Clean, resilient water for future gens”     |
| **Mission**      | Strategic  | N/A         | Directional   | “Operate safe, compliant systems”            |
| **North Star**   | Strategic  | N/A         | Unifying      | “Empower decision-making with data”          |
| **Objective**    | Strategic  | Broad       | Yes           | “Modernize field ops”                        |
| **Key Result**   | Strategic  | Focused     | Always        | “Digitize 100% of forms by Q4”               |
| **KPI**          | Strategic  | Focused     | Always        | “< 24 hrs to repair”                         |
| **Metric**       | Tactical   | Moderate    | Sometimes     | “Downtime in hours”                          |
| **Measure**      | Tactical   | Fine        | Not required  | “Cost per treatment unit”                    |
