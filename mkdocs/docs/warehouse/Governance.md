# Data Governance Frameworks

This page outlines key data governance frameworks relevant to utilities, public agencies, and enterprises undergoing analytics modernization, compliance alignment, or digital transformation. It compares models and supports framework selection based on strategic priorities and organizational context.

---

## Definition

**Data governance** is the discipline of defining, implementing, and enforcing the policies, processes, roles, and standards that ensure high-quality, secure, and trustworthy data across an organization.

---

## Objectives

- Establish clear accountability for data assets  
- Ensure compliance with regulatory and security requirements  
- Enable reliable analytics and reporting  
- Support enterprise-wide data quality and stewardship  
- Align data-related decisions with strategic and operational goals  

---

## Core Components of a Governance Framework

1. **Policies and Standards**  
   Naming conventions, data classifications, retention, access

2. **Processes and Workflows**  
   Issue resolution, access approval, data lifecycle management

3. **Roles and Responsibilities**  
   Owners, stewards, custodians, governance councils

4. **Metadata and Lineage**  
   Catalogs, business glossaries, lineage visualization

5. **Monitoring and Metrics**  
   Quality scoring, policy compliance, SLA adherence

## Frameworks Commonly Used in Utilities

### 1. **DMBOK (Data Management Body of Knowledge)**  
- Published by DAMA International  
- Defines 11 data management knowledge areas  
- Widely used in utilities, public sector, and regulated industries  
- Emphasizes governance maturity and stewardship

### 2. **AWWA G430 / G480 Standards**  
- Performance and asset management standards specific to utilities  
- G430 focuses on security and operational risk  
- G480 provides a utility management system model, including reporting, planning, and data use  
- Frequently used in performance benchmarking and audits

### 3. **ISO 8000**  
- International standard for data quality and master data exchange  
- Emphasizes data portability, provenance, and validation  
- Aligns well with SCADA, GIS, and public infrastructure data systems

### 4. **DCAM (Data Management Capability Assessment Model)**  
- Developed by the EDM Council  
- Focuses on enterprise data governance maturity  
- Domains include data ownership, quality, lineage, and platform enablement  
- Applied in utilities with digital governance and data product strategies

### 5. **NIST RMF and CSF**  
- Frameworks for cybersecurity, asset inventory, and resilience  
- Includes risk-based categorization, protection, and recovery planning  
- Common in SCADA/ICS environments and federally funded infrastructure

### 6. **COBIT**  
- IT governance and internal control framework  
- Supports accountability, process auditability, and maturity modeling  
- Often used in enterprise IT and CIO-led governance programs

### 7. **COSO ERM (Enterprise Risk Management)**  
- Control and compliance-oriented framework used in finance and utility board governance  
- Aligns with internal audit functions, SOX compliance, and organizational risk appetite  
- Complements NIST and COBIT in larger or more regulated environments

### 8. **Custom or Hybrid Approaches**  
- Many utilities combine AWWA, DMBOK, or DCAM with internal charters and regulatory policies  
- Governance-as-practice approaches include OKR dashboards, data councils, and agile stewardship  
- Hybrids reflect utility-specific regulatory context, staffing realities, and legacy systems

| Framework         | Sector Fit        | Orientation              | Common Use Cases                                |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **DMBOK**         | General            | Lifecycle-based           | Public agencies, regulated infrastructure       |
| **AWWA G430/G480**| Water utilities    | Operational, standards-based| Accreditation, board review, audits          |
| **ISO 8000**      | Industrial/global  | Data quality & exchange   | SCADA, GIS, sensor telemetry                    |
| **DCAM**          | Enterprise/finance | Capability maturity       | Governance maturity, platform enablement        |
| **NIST RMF/CSF**  | Critical infra     | Cybersecurity & resilience| SCADA/ICS protection, federal mandates          |
| **COBIT**         | IT/Finance         | Audit/process             | CIO oversight, internal controls                |
| **COSO ERM**      | Board/Audit        | Risk and compliance       | SOX, finance, executive governance              |
| **Hybrid**        | Cross-functional   | Contextual, agile         | OKR dashboards, stewardship councils            |

## Governance Roles

- **Data Owner** – Accountable for data quality and authorized use  
- **Data Steward** – Maintains definitions, rules, and term consistency  
- **Data Custodian** – Manages infrastructure, access control, and backups  
- **Governance Council** – Approves standards, reviews escalations, ensures alignment  
- **Data Consumer** – Uses governed data for operations, analytics, or decisions  

---

## Governance Metrics

- Percentage of systems with assigned data owners  
- Share of critical data elements documented in glossary/catalog  
- Ratio of Tier 1 datasets with defined quality rules  
- Average time to resolve steward-raised issues  
- Adoption rate of standardized business definitions in reporting

---

## OKRs for Governance Maturity

**Objective:**  
Establish a trusted, transparent data governance foundation that supports operational reliability, regulatory compliance, and enterprise analytics.

**Key Results:**
- Assign ownership to 100% of Tier 1 datasets by Q2  
- Document business glossary terms for all finance and asset systems by Q3  
- Reduce unresolved data quality issues (>30 days) by 90%  
- Launch automated metadata workflows with steward feedback by year-end
