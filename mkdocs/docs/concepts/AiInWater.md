# AI for Water and Wastewater Utilities

## 1. Use Cases

### Predictive Asset Management
- Forecast pump and blower failures using SCADA + CMMS data.
- Supports proactive maintenance and cost avoidance.

### Smart Leak Detection
- Detect distribution system leaks via acoustic and DMA flow data.
- Reduces non-revenue water and unplanned repair costs.

### Process Optimization
- Real-time control of chemical dosing and aeration.
- Combines sensor data with historical performance for efficiency gains.

### PFAS Treatment Design
- Predict GAC breakthrough performance across contaminants and media.
- Informs treatment selection and lifecycle planning.

### Customer Demand Insights
- Analyze AMI patterns to detect anomalies and segment usage behaviors.
- Improves conservation targeting and leak response.

### Regulatory Risk Monitoring
- Predict potential NPDES or MCL violations using historic and real-time data.
- Enables early warning and corrective action.

### Operator Decision Support
- Deliver model recommendations via dashboards or digital twins.
- Augments SOPs with data-driven prompts and alerts.

## 2. EDW and BI as AI Foundations

Before AI, utilities must modernize how data is managed and trusted. An enterprise data warehouse (EDW) — supported by a BI layer — creates the **governance scaffolding** that enables AI to be explainable, reproducible, and effective.

### Key Roles of EDW/BI in AI Readiness:
- **Data Quality**: Centralizes and cleanses data across SCADA, LIMS, CMMS, GIS, and GL systems.
- **Lineage and Traceability**: Ensures AI inputs are transparent, auditable, and version-controlled.
- **Standardized Metrics**: Unifies definitions (e.g., “unplanned downtime”) across the enterprise.
- **BI Layer**: Operationalizes AI outputs into dashboards that are actionable for staff and managers.

## 3. AI Readiness and Pilot Roadmap

### Phase 1: Readiness Assessment
- Inventory existing systems and data quality across domains.
- Establish use case priorities with operators, IT, and finance.
- Evaluate data pipeline tooling (e.g., dbt, Dagster, DuckDB) and team skills.

### Phase 2: Pilot Project Design
- **Pump Failure Prediction**: Classify at-risk pumps using SCADA and CMMS.
- **PFAS Optimization**: Model breakthrough using lab data and GAC specs.
- **Demand Anomaly Detection**: Cluster customer usage from AMI data.

### Phase 3: Integration and Scaling
- Automate transformations (Bronze → Silver → Gold) with dbt and Dagster.
- Serve AI outputs into BI tools (Metabase, Grafana, Power BI).
- Define governance workflows: model retraining, explainability, drift detection.
