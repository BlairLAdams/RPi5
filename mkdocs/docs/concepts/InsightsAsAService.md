### **Opportunity Statement: Transitioning from Founders to Framework**

Hazen's Utility Management Services (UMS) practice has emerged from a coalition of subject matter experts delivering value across specialized areas: AI, BI, GIS, CMMS, SCADA, LIMS, WIMS, BIM, Asset Management, Digital Twins, No Code / Low Code Solutions, and Custom Software. This founding team has driven impactful outcomes through domain-specific leadership and technical depth, often in a bootstrapped, entrepreneurial mode.

As demand grows for integrated digital services and scalable delivery models, UMS is presented with a pivitol opportunity. The absence of a shared vision and structured framework will limit the division's ability to scale consistently, resulting in duplicated efforts, unclear engagement models, and internal ambiguity. Without defined leadership, best practice design patterns, or a roadmap toward maturity (e.g., [CMMi Level 3+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model_Integration)), client pursuits are often reactive rather than strategic and staff attrition has begun to reflect the strain of this ambiguity.

Critically, this transition comes at a moment of market inflection. Many competitors remain narrowly focused on vendor-specific implementations or standalone technologies. Hazen has the opportunity to differentiate by offering cross-disciplinary, insight-led digital services grounded in deep utility experience and aligned to enterprise decision-making. But doing so requires moving beyond heroics and vertical silos toward a unified platform with a clear narrative, repeatable delivery models, and a leadership structure capable of harmonizing innovation with scale.

### **Executive Summary: Hazen's Differentiated Position in Digital Services**

Hazen and Sawyer is uniquely positioned to lead utilities through the *next era of digital transformation* not by pushing pre-packaged apps or off-the-shelf platforms, but by designing and delivering *governance-first data ecosystems* that support strategic decisions across planning, operations, and compliance.

While many competitors emphasize productized tools (e.g., digital twins, dashboards, or SCADA overlays), Hazen's approach is to unify the client's *data ecosystem* connecting: SCADA, LIMS, GIS, CMMS, AMI, Service Requests, and financial systems into a scalable, governed, and insight-rich architecture. This shift moves clients from tool silos toward a *utility-owned data and decisions ecosystem* that empowers long-term resilience and agility.

**This philosophy aligns well with Hazen's DNA as a professional services firm:**

* **We solve problems, not sell subscriptions.**  
   Hazen's focus is on enabling lasting outcomes through trusted advisory and technical integration—not monetizing platform lock-in.  
* **We guide transformation with utility-specific expertise.**  
   Hazen blends vertical water domain expertise with cross-cutting data architecture, allowing digital solutions to reflect the true regulatory, operational, and community context.  
* **We build for flexibility, not features.**  
   Rather than chasing product roadmaps, Hazen co-designs open architectures that evolve with the client's needs—avoiding sunk costs in rigid platforms.  
* **We prioritize governance, stewardship, and outcomes.**  
   Our digital services emphasize metadata, lineage, data contracts, and decision frameworks—key tenets often overlooked by vendors.

By structuring engagements around *data governance*, *decision enablement*, and *modular orchestration*, Hazen can deliver lightweight, scalable solutions that utilities can build on, not be boxed in by. This positions Hazen not as another vendor in the "digital tools arms race," but as a strategic partner helping clients make sense of complexity and chart their own digital course.

Most competitors emphasize tools (GIS, CMMS, LIMS, BIM, SCADA overlays, digital twins, dashboards). Hazen can carve out a distinctive position by delivering *systems of understanding* instead of just *systems of record*. Here's how:

**1\. Data-Centric Architecture, Not Tool-Centric Deployments**

* **Competitor Pattern:** App-centric, piecemeal rollouts (e.g., digital twin here, dashboard there).  
* **Hazen Differentiator:** Promote an *integrated data ecosystem* that connects SCADA, LIMS, CMMS, GIS, and AMI into a centralized, governed Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW).  
* **Benefit:** Utilities gain unified visibility, reducing dependence on vendor-specific UIs and formats.

**2\. IP Stewardship and Data Governance Leadership**

* **Competitor Weakness:** Treat data as exhaust of software platforms.  
* **Hazen Advantage:** Emphasize the utility's data as *strategic intellectual property*.  
* **Solution:** Establish clear *data stewardship roles*, *metadata contracts*, and *lineage documentation* aligned with best practices and utility goals.

**3\. Decision Intelligence Playbooks**

* **Idea:** Offer not just dashboards, but *decision playbooks* that define:  
  * What decisions need to be made  
  * What data supports them  
  * What thresholds or alerts matter  
* **Outcome:** Empowers staff to act on insights, not just view trends.

**4\. Governance-Driven Design Templates**

* **Offer:** Template-based project accelerators built from real regulatory and planning workflows.  
* **Use Case:** A digital standard plan for wastewater permit renewal, stormwater MS4 compliance, or energy recovery project vetting.  
* **Advantage:** Moves Hazen from "custom builds" to "governance-aligned reuse."

**5\. Vertical Domain Knowledge \+ Horizontal DevOps**

* **Pattern:** Many competitors either know water or software—but not both.  
* **Hazen Edge:** Pair **deep water sector SMEs** (e.g., nutrient loading, recycled water blending rules) with **agile, DevOps-fluent analysts and developers** to rapidly prototype and deploy.  
* **Differentiation:** Builds trust with operators while accelerating innovation cycles.

## **SWOT Analysis: Hazen's Shift to Insight Infrastructure-Based Digital Services**

**Strengths**

Hazen possesses deep, institutional knowledge of water and wastewater systems, with a long-standing reputation for delivering technically rigorous, trusted engineering solutions. This reputation creates a strong foundation for offering digital advisory services that prioritize trust, governance, and utility ownership. Unlike software vendors, Hazen is not viewed as selling a product, which allows it to enter client conversations with a neutral stance and focus on enabling utility-led outcomes.

Hazen also has emerging internal expertise in open-source tools (e.g., PostgreSQL, dbt, Dagster, Metabase) that form the backbone of scalable, modular architectures. These assets enable Hazen to build insight infrastructure that clients can understand, own, and evolve—without being locked into a proprietary vendor ecosystem. The firm's presence across the U.S. and its embedded client relationships provide strong channels for piloting this new delivery model.

**Weaknesses**

Current team structures are organized around tool-specific expertise (e.g., GIS, CMMS, LIMS) rather than cross-functional, outcome-oriented delivery. This creates bottlenecks and handoffs that limit the agility and cohesion needed for modern digital projects. Agile delivery practices, DevOps fluency, and structured governance frameworks (e.g., metadata contracts, data lineage) are still nascent internally.

The firm also lacks a consolidated digital identity—there is no branded method, platform, or reusable delivery framework that defines "what digital means" at Hazen. This can cause internal confusion and inconsistent client messaging. There may also be cultural resistance to reorganizing from discipline-based teams into agile pods, especially where digital work has historically been scoped as add-ons rather than core deliverables.

**Opportunities**

The water sector is entering a critical moment of digital maturity: utilities are overwhelmed with siloed tools and dashboards but are increasingly asking for *insight orchestration*, *data governance*, and *decision readiness*. Regulatory agencies are emphasizing transparency, traceability, and defensible planning—needs that tool-centric solutions struggle to meet.

Hazen can capitalize by offering a modular, ecosystem-based model centered on client-owned data and decisions. Packaging this as a branded "Insight Infrastructure Blueprint" or "Decision Infrastructure Framework" allows Hazen to codify its knowledge, differentiate from competitors, and scale repeatable digital engagements across utilities. There is also growing interest in quick-start MVPs and budget-friendly pilots that can seed larger digital programs—an ideal fit for Hazen's professional services model.

Internally, this shift presents a chance to unify scattered digital efforts, elevate new roles (data engineers, digital BAs, governance leads), and foster a culture of reusability, collaboration, and agile delivery. Externally, Hazen can become the preferred partner for utilities seeking strategic independence from vendor platforms.

**Threats**

Competitors such as AECOM, Stantec, CDM Smith, and Black & Veatch are investing heavily in digital product lines and integrated toolchains. These offerings are often paired with strong branding, marketing, and packaged "smart utility" platforms that may appeal to executive decision-makers—even if they are ultimately rigid or shallow. Hazen risks being overshadowed if its value proposition is not articulated clearly and backed by branded, reusable methods.

Clients may also struggle to differentiate Hazen's offering from traditional engineering services unless the digital strategy is visibly separate, measurable, and easy to pilot. Internally, there is a threat of stagnation if pods are not resourced properly or if project managers default to waterfall-style delivery that undermines the intent of agility. Finally, without stronger investment in internal training, onboarding, and delivery infrastructure, Hazen may lack the capacity to meet growing digital demand at scale.

**Suggested Augmentation Summary:**

* Improved clarity on internal restructuring needs (agile pods, governance roles, upskilling).  
* Stronger articulation of competitors' branding and market pressure.  
* Emphasized threat of being misinterpreted as a generalist engineering firm without a clear digital services identity.  
* Framed opportunities in terms of both internal transformation and client demand convergence (traceability, defensibility, integration).

## **Proposal: Positioning Hazen's Digital Services for Strategic Growth**

**Subject: Differentiating Hazen in the Digital Water Services Market**

**Executive Summary**

As digital transformation accelerates across the water sector, Hazen and Sawyer is well-positioned to lead not through a product-first model, but through *data-centric service delivery*. This proposal outlines how Hazen can differentiate itself from competitors who emphasize applications, by addressing the deeper market need: *an integrated, governed ecosystem that supports insight-driven decision-making*. This strategy reinforces Hazen's role as a trusted professional services provider—not a platform vendor.

**Market Context and Emerging Need**

The current generation of digital offerings in the water sector is dominated by narrowly focused tools: digital twins, dashboards, SCADA overlays, and asset management portals. While valuable, these often:

* Operate in silos  
* Depend on proprietary data models  
* Fail to address long-term governance or interoperability  
* Require high effort to align with actual utility workflows

**Market signals point to a deeper need:**

* Utilities want *control over their data*, not just new apps.  
* Decision-makers are overwhelmed by fragmented tools lacking context.  
* Operational staff are demanding insights, not just reports.  
* Boards and regulators are asking for *traceable, explainable* planning and compliance logic.

The future isn't tool proliferation—it's *decision infrastructure*.

**Competitive Landscape Snapshot**

Most large firms are doubling down on productization or tool integration:

**Jacobs, Stantec, & AECOM**

* Focus on digital twins, SCADA/IoT overlays, and platform-specific rollouts  
* Emphasize app delivery, not ecosystem strategy  
* Risk vendor lock-in or shallow alignment with actual utility governance

**CDM Smith, HDR, Arcadis**

* Offer strong asset management modeling but tied to specific toolchains  
* Emphasize data visualization but less on traceability or stewardship

**Brown and Caldwell, Black & Veech**

* Regionally nimble, some open-source interest, but limited ecosystem maturity

**Key Differentiator:**  
 These competitors treat data as a byproduct of tools. Hazen can treat data as *strategic infrastructure*—positioning us as an ecosystem partner, not a software integrator.

**Hazen's Unique Advantage as a Professional Services Firm**

Hazen's strength lies not in product development, but in our ability to co-create scalable, governance-aligned solutions with our clients. This allows us to:

* **Prioritize interoperability:** Use open standards and modular architecture to avoid lock-in (e.g., PostgreSQL, dbt, Dagster, Metabase).  
* **Support decision-making, not just monitoring:** Provide decision frameworks that connect raw data to planning, policy, and funding outcomes.  
* **Embed governance and stewardship:** Build metadata, data lineage, and stakeholder roles directly into our architectures.  
* **Deliver incrementally:** Offer short, targeted engagements (3–6 months, \<$100k) that build trust and value fast—ideal for pilot-ready utilities.

This *ecosystem-first* strategy aligns with how professional services firms add value:

* We deliver tailored, not templated solutions.  
* We build capability, not dependency.  
* We emphasize trust, not tech demos.

**Codify Our Approach into a Branded Framework**

*Proposed Name: "Insight Infrastructure Blueprint"*

**What this means:**  
Develop a standardized, repeatable framework that outlines how Hazen approaches digital ecosystem design—from data source mapping and metadata contracts to decision playbooks and architecture patterns. This provides clarity for clients and repeatability for internal teams.

**Why it matters:**

* Converts domain expertise into intellectual property  
* Establishes a "signature method" that differentiates Hazen in proposals and interviews  
* Provides internal guardrails and reduces dependency on product-specific workflows

**What it should include:**

* Data architecture patterns (Bronze/Silver/Gold medallion)  
* Tool-agnostic stack references (e.g., PostgreSQL, dbt, Dagster, etc.)  
* Sample metadata contracts and lineage templates  
* Use case mapping to regulatory, O\&M, planning, and compliance decisions

**Develop Short-Format Offer Sheets for Pilot Clients**

*Goal: Create 3–6 month MVP packages priced \<$100K*

**What this means:**  
 Design modular service packages that solve one narrow, high-value problem for the client—such as streamlining permit reporting, capital prioritization, or real-time condition monitoring.

**Why it matters:**

* Reduces barrier to entry for digital engagements  
* Builds trust through results, not PowerPoints  
* Easier for public agencies to fund with discretionary budgets

**Examples:**

* "Permit Intelligence MVP" – automate reporting logic for NPDES/Title 22  
* "Decision Dashboards for Pump Stations" – link runtime, temperature, and failure history to early warnings  
* "Capital Planning Optimizer" – expose buried Excel logic in a defensible BI tool

  **Invest in a Cross-Functional Ecosystem Team**

*Goal: Break down product-skill silos (GIS, CMMS, LIMS) in favor of agile project squads*

**What this means:**  
 Reorganize digital delivery into **cross-disciplinary pods** that include:

* One water-sector SME (e.g., permitting, treatment, master planning)  
* One business analyst or data product manager  
* One data engineer/developer (Python, SQL, dbt, etc.)  
* One system integration/GIS or CMMS resource  
* One QA and visualization specialist

**Why it matters:**

* Reduces handoffs and rework  
* Builds a culture of collaboration over handoffs  
* Enables agile delivery of MVPs that evolve with client needs

**Scaling model:**  
 Borrow from **Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)** but keep it light:

* Projects \= value streams  
* Pods \= agile teams with assigned business value owners  
* Align roles and sprints to use-case delivery, not software module deliverables

**Transition tip:**  
 Use *pilot engagements* to form temporary pods from existing monocultures. Measure success and team velocity before making permanent org changes.

**Create a "Data Readiness Assessment" Tool**

*Goal: Offer rapid utility maturity assessments as a business development tool*

**What this means:**  
 Build a diagnostic tool that evaluates where a client stands on digital readiness:

* Data governance maturity  
* Interoperability gaps across LOB systems  
* Decision-making bottlenecks  
* Infrastructure and skill capacity for analytics

**Why it matters:**

* Allows Hazen to shape the scope of future engagements  
* Gives the client a roadmap they can socialize internally  
* Creates "pull" instead of "push" for digital services

**Format:**

* 2-week fixed-price assessment  
* Intake interviews \+ system diagramming  
* Scoring aligned to DMBOK and utility objectives  
* Output \= roadmap and prioritized use cases

**Re-Architecting Teams for Adaptive Delivery**

Hazen's strength in domain expertise must now be matched with **agile delivery capabilities**. Current internal structures are organized around technologies (GIS, CMMS, SCADA) rather than outcomes. To deliver on our ecosystem vision, we need **diversified project squads** that:

* Span vertical (water domain) and horizontal (data/tech) competencies  
* Can be mobilized by project, not by discipline  
* Deliver value incrementally in 2–4 week sprints

This shift is not just a staffing change—it's a cultural reorientation. It enables Hazen to move from being a trusted design partner to being a *long-term digital transformation partner*, capable of iteratively delivering, scaling, and stewarding insight infrastructure with clients.

**Conclusion**

The digital water market is evolving from flashy applications to *foundational insight ecosystems*. Hazen's path forward lies not in mimicking product vendors, but in amplifying our greatest asset: our deep client trust and systems-thinking expertise. By positioning ourselves as *the integrator of insight ecosystems*, we help utilities own their data, govern their decisions, and adapt with confidence.

# Hazen Digital Services Pod – Onboarding Guide

## Welcome to Hazen's Digital Ecosystem Team

You've been selected to join a new kind of delivery team—a **cross-functional Agile Pod** that helps our clients build the digital infrastructure needed to make smarter, faster, and more transparent decisions. Unlike traditional project teams focused on single tools or reports, our pods deliver *ecosystem-based solutions* that unify people, data, and systems.

## What Is an Agile Pod?

A **Digital Services Pod** is a small, dedicated team composed of members from different disciplines working together toward a single mission: deliver a focused digital outcome (like a permit dashboard, data pipeline, or decision support model) that solves a real client problem in 3–6 months.

Each pod contains:

* **Water Domain Lead** – Brings operational, regulatory, or planning knowledge
* **Product Owner / Business Analyst** – Connects client needs to sprint goals
* **Data Engineer / Architect** – Builds models and pipelines (SQL, dbt, Dagster)
* **Platform Integration Specialist** – Connects core utility systems (CMMS, GIS, SCADA)
* **Visualization & QA Specialist** – Builds dashboards and validates logic

## Why We're Doing This

Hazen's traditional skill groups (GIS, SCADA, CMMS, etc.) are high-performing—but structured around tools, not outcomes. Utilities are now asking for more:

* "Can you *connect* our systems?"
* "Can you *visualize* what matters?"
* "Can you *help us decide*?"

The answer requires a team, not just a product. Agile pods make that possible—by putting all needed skills in one room, organized by the **client's problem**, not our org chart.

## What to Expect in Your First 30 Days

### Week 1–2: Orientation & Alignment

* Meet your **pod members**
* Review the client's problem statement, business case, and system landscape
* Participate in a *story-mapping workshop* to break the project into sprint-ready chunks

### Week 3–4: Sprint Zero

* Help define MVP scope, backlog items, and definition of done
* Set up dev environments, Git workflows, and data access
* Begin first implementation sprint

### Ongoing:

* Join **weekly standups** (15 mins), **biweekly sprint reviews**, and **monthly cross-pod retro**
* Track your work in Azure DevOps (or similar backlog tool)
* Use Hazen's **Insight Infrastructure Blueprint** for architecture, templates, and examples

## How We Work

* **We deliver value every sprint** – even small pieces of functionality should be demonstrable.
* **We reuse and generalize** – If something is useful here, it might be useful elsewhere.
* **We protect the client's data** – Use governance best practices, even for MVPs.
* **We iterate** – MVPs come first, perfection later.
* **We learn** – Through retros, lunch & learns, and shared assets.
